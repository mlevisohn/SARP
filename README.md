## Student Airborne Research Program, Summer 2022

Methane is the second most important greenhouse gas in the atmosphere due to its large global warming potential. Methane concentrations oscillate seasonally but have continued to increase in recent years. A major source of methane comes from agriculture, specifically cows. However, measurements of methane in and around dairy farms are minimal and the temperature dependence of these emissions is still uncertain. Previous studies have shown that in the summer, a higher boundary layer and increased photochemistry result in lower ambient levels of methane. However, it is unclear how source emissions vary between seasons. In this study, methane concentrations were measured for Whole Air Samples collected during the Student Airborne Research Program (SARP) summer flights from 2009 to 2019 and one winter flight in 2021 throughout various areas of California. Merced County, CA was found to be a methane hotspot due to the many daries within this region and exhibited the highest concentration in December 2021. This change in methane from previous flights matches both the patterns of seasonal variation and the general increase in concentration over time. The results of this study will help elucidate what influences seasonal variations in methane concentrations in agricultural areas of the Central Valley.
